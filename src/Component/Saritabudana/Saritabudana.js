The uniqueness of each child is recognized, nurtured and treasured. Emphasis is on LEARNING and not on teaching. Our focus is to develop our students as global citizens, with tolerance respect and appreciation of diverse cultures and religions for a life-time learning experience. They should be self-motivated, independent, confident decision makers to take up a leadership roles in future. We at TNEPS provide holistic education where children evolve as individuals, who are self-motivated, and creative, who can think, question and reason out logically; who are independent, confident and leaders capable of taking decisions.</p>
