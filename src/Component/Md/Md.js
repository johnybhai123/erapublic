          The New Era Public School is a proud mission driven community
          providing a world class education, celebrating the fact that each
          student is different, as a person and as a learner. We believe that
          powerful learning and teaching occurs under a shared spirit of respect
          which creates a passionate schooling experience recognized for its
          warmth, energy and excellence. Here people are valued and can fulfil
          their potential both as teachers and learners. I strongly believe that
          education is a collaborative effort that involves professional
          administrators, committed teachers and motivated students. We dedicate
          ourselves as professional administrators in creating a dynamic
          education programme empowering the students in a global perspective.
          We are a group of diverse experiences and outlooks, committed to
          excellence in preparing learners for enriched opportunities worldwide.
          In short, learning at TNEPS is a wholesome package of attitude,
          challenge and opportunity
