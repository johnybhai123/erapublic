            <p style={{padding:'40px 0 0 0'}}> The New Era Public School is a proud mission driven community providing a world class education, celebrating the fact that each student is different, as a person and as a learner. We believe that powerful learning and teaching occurs under a shared spirit of respect which creates a passionate schooling experience recognized for its warmth, energy and excellence. Here people are valued and can fulfil their potential both as teachers and learners. I strongly believe that education is a collaborative effort that involves professional administrators, committed teachers and motivated students. We dedicate ourselves as professional administrators in creating a dynamic education programme empowering the students in a global perspective. 
We are a group of diverse experiences and outlooks, committed to excellence in preparing learners for enriched opportunities worldwide. In short, learning at TNEPS is a wholesome package of attitude, challenge and opportunity
